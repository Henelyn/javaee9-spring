###MVC pattern (Model - View - Controller) 
- not the same thing as data in model/entity

- View
- Controller
- Model (data and operation on that data)

###This can be expressed as:
- View
- Controller - prepares views (Need some help from Service)
- Service (part of Model) - business logic
- Repository (part of Model) - data access layer
